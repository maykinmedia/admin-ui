# Design tokens

Admin-UI supports customizable styling with dark mode support. Customization is achieved through a set of design tokens
located in `src/design-tokens/tokens`. These tokens must be compiled using
[Style Dictionary](https://styledictionary.com/) before they can be used.

After compilation, the processed tokens are output to `src/design-tokens/compiled`, where they are consumed by the main
stylesheet in `src/index.scss`.

## Compilation

To compile the updated design tokens, run the following command:

npm run build:design-tokens

## Token structure

Design tokens are defined as JSON objects containing a `value`, and optionally a `type` and other attributes. The token
path is transformed into meaningful variables for a specific platform. Admin-UI uses CSS custom properties as the output
format. Token values can be direct platform-compatible values or references to other tokens.

### Example

Given the following token definition:

The following token:

```json
{
  "button": {
    "color": {
      "background": {
        "primary": {
          "value": "{page.color.primary}"
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Gets compiled to

```css
--button-color-background-primary: var(--page-color-primary);
```

## Token files

The token files in `src/design-tokens/tokens` are organized by role. During compilation:

- Tokens **without** a `type: "font"` attribute are merged and output to `src/design-tokens/compiled/properties.css`.
- Tokens **with** a `type: "font"` attribute are transformed into `@font-face` definitions and output to
`src/design-tokens/compiled/fonts.css`.

## Best practices for updating styles

When modifying design tokens, follow these best practices:

- **Ensure accessibility**: Maintain proper color contrast for readability.
- **Use references**: Reference existing tokens where possible to simplify future customizations.
- **Test changes**: Verify styles in different themes (dark mode) and viewports to prevent regressions.

> **Reminder:** After updating the tokens, recompile and rebuild Admin-UI to apply the changes.
