# Internationalization (i18n)

Messages provided by Admin-ui can be translated, by default: translations for Dutch (default) and English are provided.

## Providing translations

This UI library supports the following for scenarios:

- An application with extensive Internationalization support
  (using [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/).

- An application with basic Internationalization using translates labels
  passed as props.

- No internalisation (default messages only).

**Extensive Internationalization support (using [react-intl](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/))**

If react-intl is installed and `IntlContext` is provided by `<IntlProvider>`, this library will attempt to use it to
obtain messages from it given that the messages are not explicitly provided using props (which takes precedence).

The (compiled) messages are made available as JSON file in the dist/messages folder. The messages should be provided to
`<IntlProvider>`.


**Internationalization using translates labels passed as props**

For basic use cased, translations can be passed using props. Please refer to the specific components for labels
available for translations.


**No internalisation (default messages only)**

If react-intl is not installed or using `IntlContext` fails, a fallback implementation is used for providing translations.


## Managing translations

**Providing translatable strings (during development)**

Components should implement a `label<key>` prop for each translations that should take precedence if it's passed. If
it's left empty, a translation should be obtained using the `src/lib/i18n/useIntl.tsx` `useIntl`. This hook will return
the correct "intl" implementation based on whether react-intl is available.

`useIntl` take a locale as optional argument, if it's not set, an attempt is made for the body's `lang` attribute to be
 used as locale. If no locale can be resolved "nl" is the default  value.

 For pragmatic reasons: translation labels should be written in Dutch and should provide an explicit id. Also: the
 description should identify the component and description of the prop.

```tsx
const intl = useIntl("en");  // locale can be left empty.


// labelTrue is a prop.
// _labelTrue is the rendered string.
const _labelTrue =
  labelTrue ||
  intl.formatMessage({
    id: "mykn.components.Bool.labelTrue",
    description: "mykn.components.Bool: The accessible label when value is truthy",
    defaultMessage: "ja",
  });
```

**Extracting and compiling messages (before build)**

Messages can be extracted by running `npm run makemessages` after which they end up in src/lib/i18n/messages, they can
be compiled after translation using `npm run compilemessages`.

Copying the messages to the dist folder should be handled as part of the `npm run build` command. This allows
applications to consume the compiled translations.
