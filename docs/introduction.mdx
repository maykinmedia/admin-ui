## Introduction

**Admin-ui** is the official (React) component library developed and maintained by **Maykin Media**, specifically
designed for **admin-like applications** within our projects. It provides a **consistent, efficient, and accessible**
foundation for application interfaces.

By standardizing UI components, Admin-ui helps teams **streamline development, ensure a cohesive user experience,
and reduce maintenance overhead** across multiple projects.

## Project goals

- **Consistency** – Maintain a uniform UI across all Maykin Media admin panels, dashboards, and tools.
- **Efficiency** – Speed up development with ready-to-use components optimized for admin workflows.
- **Accessibility** – Ensure compliance with WCAG standards by default.

## Getting Started

Admin-ui is intended for use in **Maykin Media** projects. To install it, run:

```sh
npm install @maykin-ui/admin-ui
```

Admin-ui provides collection of **templates**, **components**, **contexts**, **hooks** and **libraries** are exposed to
be used in external applications.

Using a component:
```tsx
import {Button} from "@maykin-ui/admin-ui";

<Button variant="primary">Primary Button</Button>
```

### Templates

A template is a predefined structure or blueprint that defines the layout and presentation of a user interface without
containing the actual data. Templates are composed out of multiple components an may pass certain prop (objects) to
components to allow overriding their behaviour. Refer to the respective templates stories for more information.

Various templates are available for various use cases like listing
data, or providing a login page.

### Components

A component is a reusable, self-contained piece of the user interface (UI) that encapsulates structure, styling, and
behavior. Components can be "composed" to build modular, scalable, and maintainable UIs. Just like templates: components
can be made out of other components and may allow overriding nested props.

Components are subdivided into:

- **Page layout**: grid system and friends for specifying the page layout.
- **Building blocks**: foundations of a user interface (cards/modals).
- **Controls**: components that control data flow.
- **Typography**: typographic elements for showing text.
- **Icons**: Admin-ui wraps [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/).
- **Data presentation**: various components for displaying data.
- **Form rendering**: Various components for showing forms.
- **Brand identity**: The Maykin Brand.

### Contexts

Context refers to a shared state or data that is accessible to multiple components without having to pass it down
manually through props. Context is commonly used to manage global state.

> If a component always requires context to work, it loses composability because it cannot be reused outside the provider.

Certain information/configuration can be exposed using provided contexts, however: by convention, admin-ui never relies
solely on context as provider and must accept props as alternative for any value that is consumed from a context*.


***ModalService** is an exception to this rule.*

### Hooks

Hooks are functions that allow components to use state, lifecycle methods, and other React features.

Various hooks are provided to simplify certain patterns (like prompting for user input).


### Libraries

Admin-ui exposes certain libraries so that internal behavior can be reproduced by other projects.

_**TODO**: Document libraries_

### Translations

Admin-ui supports React-intl to provide translations, a collection of (compiled) language translations files can be
found in `/dist/esm/lib/i18n/compiled`. If react-intl is not used, Admin-ui falls backs to a custom implementation using
the lang attribute (`<html lang="en">`) as language identifier.

### Engineering patterns

While working with admin-ui, please take the following te patterns in mind.

#### Accessibility matters

_Explanation_

As developers, we can make the web a better place, please check you work for accessibility standards. Especially check
for color contrast according to
[WCAG standards (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

_Motivation_

Not everyone interacts with the web in the same way. Accessibility ensures that users with disabilities,
including those who are blind, deaf, or have mobility impairments, can fully engage with digital content.

Additionally: many (government) organisation explicitly demand (and check) for compliance to WCAG standards.

_**TODO**: Test for and fix accessibility issues._

#### Composing props

_Explanation_

In certain cases like the `Form` component, prop shapes like `InputProps`  or `SelectProps` (and others) are accepted
as part of an array passed to the `fields` prop. Another example: the `ToolbarComponent` takes an `items` prop which may
contain prop shapes like `ButtonProps` or `InputProps`. The toolbar itself may be used in other components (like `Form`) to render
specific action controls.

_Motivation_

This allows for features like auto rendering forms and toolbars without duplicating props. Future efforts will
automatically become available to components implementing such features and specific nested behavior can easily be
overridden.

#### Contexts must remain optional

_Explanation_

A component should not depend on the presence of a context for it to work. Any value obtained from a context should also
be passable as prop.

_Motivation_

If a component always requires context to work, it loses composability because it cannot be reused outside the provider.
