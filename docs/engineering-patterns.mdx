# Engineering patterns

While working with admin-ui, please take the following te patterns in mind.

## Accessibility matters

_Explanation_

As developers, we can make the web a better place, please check you work for accessibility standards. Especially check
for color contrast according to
[WCAG standards (AA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).

_Motivation_

Not everyone interacts with the web in the same way. Accessibility ensures that users with disabilities,
including those who are blind, deaf, or have mobility impairments, can fully engage with digital content.

Additionally: many (government) organisation explicitly demand (and check) for compliance to WCAG standards.

_**TODO**: Test for and fix accessibility issues._

## Composing props

_Explanation_

In certain cases like the `Form` component, prop shapes like `InputProps`  or `SelectProps` (and others) are accepted
as part of an array passed to the `fields` prop. Another example: the `ToolbarComponent` takes an `items` prop which may
contain prop shapes like `ButtonProps` or `InputProps`. The toolbar itself may be used in other components (like `Form`) to render
specific action controls.

_Motivation_

This allows for features like auto rendering forms and toolbars without duplicating props. Future efforts will
automatically become available to components implementing such features and specific nested behavior can easily be
overridden.

## Contexts must remain optional

_Explanation_

A component should not depend on the presence of a context for it to work. Any value obtained from a context should also
be passable as prop.

_Motivation_

If a component always requires context to work, it loses composability because it cannot be reused outside the provider.
